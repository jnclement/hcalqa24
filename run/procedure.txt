edit "jocl" in all files to be replaced with your username
This is probably best accomplished by doing something like
sed -i 's/jocl/[username]/g' *

You will also need to compile what is in ../src to your install directory
This can be accomplished by cd-ing to your build directory and doing
[full path to src]/autogen.sh --prefix=[full path to install directory]

then running make install

Also make sure to set your install directory by sourcing the sphenix setup script with the full path to your install directory as an argument

mkdir -p output/err
mkdir -p output/out
mkdir -p output/rmg
mkdir -p output/root
mkdir -p output/sumroot
mkdir -p /sphenix/tg/tg01/jets/[username]/hcalqa/evt
      
bash getlists_list.sh (provide list of run numbers)
bash run_runs.sh [tag] 0 0

wait for runs to finish (slow)

edit get_image_lists.sh to use the tag you gave run_runs.sh

bash get_image_lists.sh
bash run_images_for_all.sh
bash allhadd.sh

edit plot.C to use the run numbers you selected

root -b -q "plot.C(args)"
